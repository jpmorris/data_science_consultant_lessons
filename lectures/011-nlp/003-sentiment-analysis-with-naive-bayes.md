# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

## What you should remember for life:

### Facts to know:

- Left side of bayes equality (e.g $P(A|B)$, "probability of A given B") The 'given' part (i.e $B$
  in this case) is in the denominator on the right side of the equation.
  - You can also derive with venn diagrams and plugging $P(A|B)$ into $P(B|A)$

# Bayes' Rule

To remember the derivation: left side of equality conditional ('given'; right of "|") equality goes
in demoninator on rightside (also true of bayes formula generally) To remember bayes formula:
remember the same rule and just remember to put the X, Y in the right place

# Applications of Naive Bayes

- Author identification - i.e. who wrote a particular document
- Spam filtering
- Information retrieval
- Word disambiguation - i.e. bank (financial institution) vs bank (side of a river)
