# Overview of GenAI Tools and Resources

This analysis was preformed on March 18, 2025 and will certainly be out of date quickly. We want to
analyze the current state of the industry in particular the vibecoding resources.

## Terminology

- AGI - Artificial General Intelligence
- ASI - Artificial Super Intelligence
- UBI - Universal Basic Income

## People and their current opinions of the industry

- Three Godfathers of AI: Jeff Hinton, Yann Lecun, Yoshua Bengio
  - Won the Turing Award in 2018

| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |----- |
| Jeff Hinton     | AI Researcher                | Believes in widespread job loss and advocates for UBI        | https://blog.getodin.ai/ai-takes-jobs-odin-offers-hope-geoffrey-hinton/ | 
| Andrew Ng       | AI Researcher                | Massive Boost in Productivity, create new jobs, but some losses are inevitable | |
| Yann Lecun      | AI Researcher                | Won't take over the world or permanently destroy jobs.        |https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65886125#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20three%20%22godfathers,humanity%20were%20%22preposterously%20ridiculous%22. |
|      | AI Researcher                |         | |
| Yoshua Bengio   | AI Researcher                | Will transform job market by replacing specific roles, it wont 'steal' jobs        | |
| Gary Marcus     | Cognitive Scientist, Founder of two AI Companies| Will transform jobs; wont take massively relplace jobs in the short term        | |
| Dario Amodei    | CEO, Anthropic               | "In the next 3 to 6 months, AI is writing 90% of Code" | | 
| Kevin Roose     | Journalist, NYTimes          | "Powerful AI is Coming. We're not Ready. | https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/technology/why-im-feeling-the-agi.html |

| Eliezer Yudkowsky | AI Researcher              | Massive Job Losses, most likely end of the world | |
| Primogen        | Software Developer (youtube) | Tools create bad code, maybe help some productivity, but not putting developers out of a job in the near to medium term        | |

## Personal risks:

- Will I lose my job in N years?
- Is there a society-level risk (misinformation, scams, hacking etc.)
- Is there a humanity-level risk (state-level threat; p-doom scenarios)
  - P(Doom) - subjective probability of existentially catastropic outcomes (i.e. 'doom') as the
    result of artificial intelligence in the long run.
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P(doom)

We'll only be focusing on the first case of personal job risk for a data scientist.
