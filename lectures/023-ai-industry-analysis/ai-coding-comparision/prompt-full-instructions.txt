The following page lists a spec for API access to data I would like to download:

https://www.justice.gov/developer/api-documentation/api_v1

I would like to download all data from the /api/v1/press_releases.json endpoint
using Python.

Please create one script that does the following:

- Steps through the endpoint from 2016-01-01 to the current date
- Steps through each page provided by the API for a given date.
- Downloads json payloads for each page and concatenates them in a list of
dictionaries.
- Takes this list of dictionaries, exports it as json to an s3 bucket.

Create a second script that:
- Takes a collection of jsons from a bucket in s3 in the same format (one for each day) 
and creates a pandas dataframe from all of them.
- Saves the pandas dataframe as csv to a different folder in the same s3 bucket
