The following page lists a spec for API access to data I would like to download:

https://www.justice.gov/developer/api-documentation/api_v1

I would like to download all data from the /api/v1/press_releases.json endpoint
using Python.

Please create code that does the following:

- Steps through the endpoint from 2016-01-01 to the current date
- Steps through each page provided by the API for a given date.
- Downloads json payloads for each page and concatenates them in a list of
dictionaries.
- Takes this list of dictionaries, exports it as json to an s3 bucket.
