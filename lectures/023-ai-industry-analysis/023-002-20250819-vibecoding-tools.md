## Task

The task is to create an API interface to download all data from the Department of Justice API site.
This project has already been completed and we would like to use it as a test case for how the
current AI coding tools perform on this relatively straightforward task.
https://www.justice.gov/developer/api-documentation/api_v1

## Browser Interfaces

- **OpenAI**
- **Google's Gemini**
- **Anthropic's Claude**
- **DeepSeek**
- **Grock**

## AI IDEs and Agentic Coding Tools

Platforms that embed AI deeply within the development environment‚Äîsome even offering autonomous or
‚Äúagentic‚Äù coding features:

### VSCode with Copilot with GPT-5

- Prompt Response is [here](./prompt-responses/vscode-gpt5.md)
- Issues:
  - I asked it to setup a `pyproject.toml` file to support a virtual environment crated with `uv`.
    It added hatchling as a build system and had a hard time installing. I removed it since I didn't
    need to build package.
  - Did not integrate my aws profile into `session()` but not really the fault of the tool that it
    wasn't aware of my environment.

### Cursor with Claude-4-Sonnet

- Prompt Response is [here](./prompt-responses/cursor-claude4-sonnet.md)

### Other

- **GitHub Copilot Agent** ‚Äì Autonomous Copilot that takes end-to-end actions within the editor.
- **QodoAI** (formerly CodiumAI) ‚Äì Agentic assistant focused on automating workflows.
- **Devin AI** (by Cognition) ‚Äì A powerful AI software engineer capable of autonomous code
  generation.
- **OpenAI Codex CLI / Agent** ‚Äì CLI-based AI coding agent integrated into tools like ChatGPT.
