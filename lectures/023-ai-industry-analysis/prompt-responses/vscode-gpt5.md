jpmorris: The following page lists a spec for API access to data I would like to download:

https://www.justice.gov/developer/api-documentation/api_v1

I would like to download all data from the /api/v1/press_releases.json endpoint
using Python.

Please create one script that does the following:

- Steps through the endpoint from 2016-01-01 to the current date
- Steps through each page provided by the API for a given date.
- Downloads json payloads for each page and concatenates them in a list of
dictionaries.
- Takes this list of dictionaries, exports it as json to an s3 bucket.

Create a second script that:
- Takes a collection of jsons from a bucket in s3 in the same format (one for each day) 
and creates a pandas dataframe from all of them.
- Saves the pandas dataframe as csv to a different folder in the same s3 bucket

GitHub Copilot: I'll open the DOJ API docs to confirm parameters (date filters, pagination) for the press releases endpoint so the scripts hit the API correctly. Then I'll scaffold two Python scripts with S3 I/O, a requirements file, and a README. I'll add two Python scripts, a requirements file, and a short README to your workspace to fetch DOJ press releases per day to S3 and then aggregate them from S3 to a CSV.

I'll fix the minor lint issues, add a minimal requirements.txt and README, then do a quick syntax check of both scripts in a terminal to ensure there are no syntax errors.

I’ll implement two Python scripts plus minimal plumbing to fetch DOJ press releases day-by-day to S3, then aggregate them from S3 into a CSV.

Requirements checklist
- Download API data 2016-01-01 → today Done
- Page through all pages per day Done
- Concatenate per-day page payloads into a list[dict] Done
- Export each day’s list as JSON to S3 Done (one file per day)
- Read a collection of per-day JSONs from S3 and make a pandas DataFrame Done
- Save the DataFrame as CSV to a different folder in the same S3 bucket Done

Actions taken
- Added downloader script: download_doj_press_releases.py
- Added aggregator script: aggregate_doj_press_releases.py
- Added requirements.txt (boto3, pandas, requests)
- Added README.md with usage
- Ran a syntax check on both scripts (no syntax errors)

Key implementation notes
- DOJ API params: pagesize up to 50, page is zero-based, date filter is parameters[date]=<epoch seconds>. Per DOJ examples, “date” corresponds to noon UTC for the given day; the downloader queries each day at 12:00:00Z (epoch) to match.
- Rate limiting: default ~5 req/sec (0.2s pause) to stay under the 10 req/sec guidance.
- S3 layout: daily files at s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/YYYY/MM/DD.json (default prefix raw/doj/press_releases).
- Aggregation: reads all .json under input prefix, concatenates into a single DataFrame, coerces nested dict/list fields to JSON strings for a flat CSV, and writes to s3://<bucket>/<out-prefix>/<out-key> (default curated/doj/press_releases.csv).

Files created
- download_doj_press_releases.py: Iterates dates and pages, collects results, writes per-day JSON to S3.
- aggregate_doj_press_releases.py: Reads per-day JSONs from S3, builds DataFrame, writes CSV to S3.
- requirements.txt: boto3, pandas, requests.
- README.md: usage, setup, notes.

How to use
- See README.md in the workspace for quickstart. Configure AWS credentials (env, shared credentials, or role).
- Downloader example: python download_doj_press_releases.py --bucket your-bucket --prefix raw/doj/press_releases --start 2016-01-01
- Aggregator example: python aggregate_doj_press_releases.py --bucket your-bucket --in-prefix raw/doj/press_releases --out-prefix curated/doj --out-key press_releases.csv

Quality gates
- Syntax check: PASS (both scripts compiled).
- Lint/type hints: Cleaned unused imports. External imports (boto3/botocore/pandas/requests) require pip install (requirements.txt provided).
- Unit tests: Not applicable here; logic is straightforward and relies on live S3/API.

Assumptions
- DOJ date filter requires the epoch for the same calendar date at 12:00 UTC. If DOJ ever changes this convention, adjust noon_utc_epoch accordingly.
- You want one JSON per day (the second script expects “one for each day”).

Next steps (optional)
- Add a flag to skip already-existing S3 keys to support resumable runs.
- Optionally compress CSV/JSON (gzip) to reduce storage and transfer.
- Add simple retry/backoff tuning and logging to CloudWatch if running on a schedule.

Completion summary
- Two runnable Python scripts created with S3 IO and DOJ API pagination and date filtering, plus requirements and README. Verified scripts compile; ready to run after installing dependencies and setting AWS credentials.

jpmorris: Please create a pyproject.toml file that supports these files managed by uv.

GitHub Copilot: I'll quickly inspect the current scripts to confirm their entry points and then add a uv-friendly pyproject.toml with project metadata and dependencies. I’ll add a minimal pyproject.toml configured for uv with project metadata, dependencies, and console scripts for your two Python entry points.

I’ll add a uv-friendly pyproject with project metadata, dependencies, and console scripts for your two entry points.

Checklist
- Inspect current scripts’ entry points Done
- Create uv-ready pyproject.toml with deps and scripts Done
- Keep README/requirements as-is (pyproject supersedes requirements) Done

What I added
- pyproject.toml configured for uv, including:
  - build-system using hatchling
  - project metadata and Python version
  - dependencies: boto3, pandas, requests
  - console scripts:
    - doj-download -> download_doj_press_releases:main
    - doj-aggregate -> aggregate_doj_press_releases:main
  - optional dev group with ruff and mypy
  - basic ruff/mypy config

Try it with uv
- Initialize/sync:
  ```bash
  uv sync
  ```
- Run the downloader:
  ```bash
  uv run doj-download --bucket <your-bucket> --prefix raw/doj/press_releases --start 2016-01-01
  ```
- Run the aggregator:
  ```bash
  uv run doj-aggregate --bucket <your-bucket> --in-prefix raw/doj/press_releases --out-prefix curated/doj --out-key press_releases.csv
  ```

Notes
- The scripts expose main() functions, so console scripts work.
- If you prefer, you can remove requirements.txt; uv will use pyproject.toml.
