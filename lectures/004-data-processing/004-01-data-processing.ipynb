    "    - Dask - user-controled paritions and dataframe per partition\n",
    "  - According non-pandas options https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwtbPhbDecQ&t=535s\n",
    "    - No option is consistently faster than the others\n",
    "      - DuckDB comes the closest\n",
    "      - At very high scale (>10TB in the cloud), dask, duckdb, and spark shoudl be considered.\n",
    "- On-disk, single machine engines (SQL):\n",
    "    - SQL wont have the memory constraints as with in-memory engines\n",
    "    - SQL result may come slower (not accounting for time to load into memory) but can handle larger datasets\n",
    "- Distributed, on-disk engines like Hadoop still have use cases, but fewer cases for data scientists workflows\n",
    "- For big data analytics, Spark is usually the better option.\n",
    "- OLAP--online analytical processing--(Apagche Druid, Kylin, Pinot) databases are an option for regular/similar business analytics queries\n",
    "  - Reminder: Databases uses can be large analytical queries, or small fast record keeping, among others\n",
    "  - OLAP is an analytical processing more for business analytics, closer to datascience\n",
    "  - OLTP is another paradigm that has more to do with transactional processing of individual records and ACID\n",
    "    - ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - part of SQL that is sacraficed in NoSQL\n",
