## Model Evaluation

### Performance Metrics

- Accuracy and its limitations
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC curves and AUC
- Precision-Recall curves
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Multi-class metrics (macro, micro, weighted averaging)

### Statistical Considerations

- Cross-validation strategies (k-fold, stratified, leave-one-out)
- Confidence intervals for metrics
- Statistical significance testing
- McNemar's test for classifier comparison

### Model Selection Criteria

- Occam's Razor principle
- AIC/BIC for model comparison
- Validation curves
- Learning curves
