    "      - S - **Single Responsibility Principle** - A class should have only one reason to change\n",
    "      - O - Open/Closed Principle - Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification\n",
    "      - L - Liskov Substitution Principle - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application\n",
    "      - I - Interface Segregation Principle - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface\n",
    "      - D - Dependency Inversion Principle - One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions\n",
    "  - Other texts say things like \"each function should have no more than 5 lines\"\n",
    "  - However this (and SRP) can cause  conflict:\n",
    "      - SRP says that a function should do one thing\n",
    "      - But the more functions the more mental transitioning when you're reading the code--procedural code without\n",
    "function calls will always be easier to read\n",
    "      - Surely not *every* function must have a single responsiblity? What about `main()` (in python scripts)?\n",
