# Micrograd Roseta Code

The purpose of this submodule is to implement Andrej Karpathy's `micrograd` (neural network from
scratch) in other languages, along with showing a survey of the features of different lanugages and
other important aspects of programming broadly.

This series follows Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero lecture series over LLMs which can be found here:
