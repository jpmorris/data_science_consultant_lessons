# near term:
- trunked based development vs gitflow (and how it relates to (our) data science repo)
- generating data:
  - own model
  - python packages
  - CTGAN
  - LLMs
  - compare outputs?


# RNN, LSTM, Transformers compared (should be part of deep learning lesson?)
- contextualize with deep learning basics
- show the code
- where is the attention?
- can we find the original transformer code?
  - `github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tesnor`

# List to cover
- Good programming practices
- Pythonic tricks
- SQL primer
- GenAI
- NLP

- more best practices:
   - Never nesters
   - Do not wrap everything in try/catch
   - No bare except
   - 
   
- CI/CD
- IDE Primer
- review of sci-kit API
- order of algorithmic complexity (show sql example timings)
- ML Theory
- Data Structures
- Design Patterns
- git primer
- cli/gnu tools primer
- python SYSPATH/PYTHONPATH/module imports
- complex problem solving strategies
- showcase personal projects
- high-performance computing
    - algorithm optimization (use graph query as example)
- review of confusion matrix - how to memorize forever
- information theory and the informational limit of datasets 

# Later
- functional programming
- dynamic programming

# from melissas spreadhseet
